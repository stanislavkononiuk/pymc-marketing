## Installation

Install and activate an environment (e.g. `marketing_env`) with the `pymc-marketing` package from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org). It may look something like the following:

```bash
mamba create -c conda-forge -n marketing_env pymc-marketing
mamba activate marketing_env
```

See the official [PyMC installation guide](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html) if more detail is needed.

## Quickstart

Create a new Jupyter notebook with either JupyterLab or VS Code.

### JupyterLab Notebook

After installing the `pymc-marketing` package (see above), run the following with `marketing_env` activated:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

### VS Code Notebook

After installing the `pymc-marketing` package (see above), run the following with `marketing_env` activated:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge ipykernel
```

Start VS Code and ensure that the "Jupyter" extension is installed. Press Ctrl + Shift + P and type "Python: Select Interpreter". Ensure that `marketing_env` is selected. Press Ctrl + Shift + P and type "Create: New Jupyter Notebook".

### MMM Quickstart

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymc_marketing import mmm


data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/main/datasets/mmm_example.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url, parse_dates=['date_week'])

model = mmm.DelayedSaturatedMMM(
    data=data,
    target_column="y",
    date_column="date_week",
    channel_columns=["x1", "x2"],
    control_columns=[
        "event_1",
        "event_2",
        "t",
        "sin_order_1",
        "cos_order_1",
        "sin_order_2",
        "cos_order_2",
    ],
    adstock_max_lag=8,
)
```

Initiate fitting and get a visualization of some of the outputs with:

```python
model.fit()
model.plot_components_contributions();
```

See the Example notebooks section for examples of further types of plot you can get, as well as introspect the results of the fitting.

### CLV Quickstart

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from pymc_marketing import clv


data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/main/datasets/clv_quickstart.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url)

beta_geo_model = clv.BetaGeoModel(
    customer_id=data.index,
    frequency=data["frequency"],
    recency=data["recency"],
    T=data["T"],
)

beta_geo_model.fit()
```
Once fitted, we can use the model to predict the number of future purchases for known customers, the probability that they are still alive, and get various visualizations plotted. See the Examples section for more on this.
